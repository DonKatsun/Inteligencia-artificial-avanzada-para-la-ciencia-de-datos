## Deployment

Additional notes on how to deploy this on a live or release system. Explaining the most important branches, what pipelines they trigger and how to update the database (if anything special).


### Feedback

* ```Big Data, ```--
* ```Deep Learning, Make the dataset smaller:```
We made the images size 100x100 in a gray scale
* ```NLP, Use a CNN:```
We used a CNN Regresor
* ```Statistics, Implement a Yolo algorith to identify the river:```
We made an I'm red filter to identify the river because implement Yolo takes a lot of time
